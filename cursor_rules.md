# Cursor Rules

Follow these instructions throughout the coding process:

## Code Organization
- Do not combine all code into one big file; use separate files for HTML (index.html), CSS (styles.css), and JS (script.js or modules like fetchWeather.js, moodGenerator.js)

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling via CDN (https://cdn.tailwindcss.com) to create a modern, smooth, and easy-to-read design

## API Usage
- Leverage free, open-source APIs only (OpenWeatherMap: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather)

## Best Practices
- Keep code modular: separate API fetching, UI updates, and AI mood generation into distinct functions or files
- Use vanilla JS unless React is explicitly requested
- Aim for a clean, minimal, modern aesthetic with smooth transitions
